# New pattern

This is a template for new pattern. Fork it to create your own.

## Usage

1. Rename files, upadate `__todo__` in the code, update readme
1. Define your workflow tasks in `pattern/tasks.py`
1. Remember to add your `init` task if your workflow requires additional dependencies (python libraries, system packages, etc.)
